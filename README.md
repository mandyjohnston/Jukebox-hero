## Group Project -  Album Collection

### Objective
Our friends at the local soda shop have gotten tired of taken phone calls about their jukebox.  After a feature in the newspaper about how cool their vintage jukebox was they have been swamped with requests from jukebox enthusiasts for an album list.

They have tasked us with creating an application that can easily keep track of their record collection and access music by albums or individual tracks.  This collection is in a constant state of flux, so it is essential for the users to be able to update the collection and it's elements.


### Single Page Application Front-end

We will need to create a front-end application to use their provided API. It should be an SPA that uses JS to build out components that our users can interact with. Use modular JS to create reusable components.  This application should allow you to create new albums and songs, leave comments on albums or songs, and delete items.

#### User Interaction

Our users should be able to add new instances of `Album` and `Song`s as well as comments.
